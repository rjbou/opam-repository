description: """
Zed is an abstract engine for text edition. It can be used to write
text editors, edition widgets, readlines, ...

Zed uses Camomile to fully support the Unicode specification, and
implements an UTF-8 encoded string type with validation, and a rope
datastructure to achieve efficient operations on large Unicode
buffers. Zed also features a regular expression search on ropes.

To support efficient text edition capabilities, Zed provides macro
recording and cursor management facilities."""
