synopsis: "Generic Graph library"
description: """
Graphlib is a generic library that extends a well known OCamlGraph
library. Graphlib uses its own, more reach, Graph interface that
is isomorphic to OCamlGraph's `Sigs.P` signature for persistant
graphs. Two functors witness the isomorphism of the interfaces:
`Graphlib.To_ocamlgraph` and `Graphlib.Of_ocamlgraph`. Thanks to
these functors, any algorithm written for OCamlGraph can be used on
`Graphlibs` graph and vice verse."""
