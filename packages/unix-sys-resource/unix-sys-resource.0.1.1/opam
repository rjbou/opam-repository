  "Unix sys/resource.h types and bindings (getrlimit, setrlimit, and friends)"
description: """
unix-sys-resource provides access to the features exposed in
sys/resource.h in a way that is not tied to the implementation on the
host system.

The Sys_resource module provides types and functions for describing and
working with rlimit resources and limits.

The Sys_resource_unix module provides bindings to functions that use the
types in Sys_resource.

Currently, getrlimit and setrlimit and their corresponding flags are
bound."""
