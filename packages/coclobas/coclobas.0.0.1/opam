synopsis: "Coclobas is a scheduler for HPC-like jobs accessible through HTTP"
description: """
It can be setup with two kinds of configurations:

- Using Kubernetes and the *Google Container Engine*,
  i.e. using a Kubernetes “eleastic” cluster setup with `gcloud` and submitting
  jobs as Kubernetes “pods”.
- Using the server's machine as a one-node cluster and submitting jobs as docker
  containers given a maximal number of jobs.

Coclobas is mostly used as a Ketrew plugin, but can be driven separately."""
