post-messages: """
new release that fixes some problems with 0.5.1,
including a better handling of backtraces, safe-string awareness,
a mode for long tests, and reverting `small_int` to being an alias to `nat`.

The latter point is important for not breaking code that would use `small_int`
to pick the size of lists, strings, etc. The new `small_signed_int` can
be used instead."""
