synopsis:
  "Tools and APIs for program analysis, code visualization, refactoring"
description: """
pfff is a set of tools and APIs to perform some static analysis,
dynamic analysis, code visualizations, code navigations, or
style-preserving source-to-source transformations such as refactorings
on source code. For now the effort is focused on PHP but there is also
good support for C, C++, Java, HTML, Javascript, Css, and preliminary
support for Erlang, Python, C#, Lisp, Scheme, Haskell, OPA, Sql, and
even TeX. There is also very good support for OCaml and noweb
(literate programming) so that pfff can be used on the code of pfff
itself.
