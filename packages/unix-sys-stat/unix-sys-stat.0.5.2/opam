  "ocaml-unix-sys-stat provides access to the features exposed in sys/stat.h"
description: """
in a way that is not tied to the implementation on the host system.

The Sys_stat module provides functions for translating between the file
types and mode bits accessible through sys/stat.h and their values on
particular systems. The Sys_stat_host module exports representations of
various hosts.

The Sys_stat_unix provides bindings to functions that use the types in
Sys_stat along with a representation of the host system. The bindings
support a more comprehensive range of flags than the corresponding
functions in the standard OCaml Unix module."""
