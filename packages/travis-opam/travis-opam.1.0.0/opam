synopsis: "Travis CI (Continuous Integration) helpers"
description: """
This package installs a set of helper tools that integrate your 
OCaml project with the Travis CI (http://travis-ci.org) online
continuous integration system.

It can test several combinations of OCaml and OPAM across multiple
Linux distributions, making it particularly handy for testing
C linkage or external library dependencies quickly.

See <https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-travisci-skeleton> for more
information and usage."""
