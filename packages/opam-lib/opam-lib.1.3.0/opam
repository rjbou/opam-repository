name: "opam-lib"
version: "1.3.0"
synopsis: "The OPAM library"
description: """
OPAM is The OCaml PAckage Manager. This package contains the OPAM
libraries, that may be used by external tools to access OPAM
installation, state and data.

Note: this version does not correspond to a released version of opam, but has
some improvements over the 1.2.2 opam-lib while retaining the compatibility with
the ~/.opam format; later versions (2.0) are no longer compatible. This can be
sused as a first step for migration."""
