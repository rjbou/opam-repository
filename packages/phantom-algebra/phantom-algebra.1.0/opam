synopsis: "A strongly-typed tensor library à la GLSL"
description: """
Phantom-algebra is a pure OCaml library implementing strongly-typed
small tensors with dimensions 0 ≤ 4, rank ≤ 2, and limited to square matrices.

It makes it possible to manipulate vector and matrix expressions with an
uniform notation while still catching non-sensical operations at compile time"""
