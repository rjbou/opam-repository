synopsis: "Haskell-style `where` clauses as a PPX syntax extension"
description: """
ppx_where allows for the use of `where` clauses after expressions
by rewriting the `where` syntax into `let ... in` syntax at
compile-time. Additionally, ppx_where allows for some limited
pattern matching such as that allowed in-place for arguments
in normal function bindings."""
