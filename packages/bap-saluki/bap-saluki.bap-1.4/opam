synopsis:
  "A verification framework for detecting vulnerability patterns in binaries"
description: """
Saluki framework allows users to easily specify properties for de-
tecting taint-style vulnerabilities automatically, drastically
reducing the need for manual auditing of binaries. Prop- erties are
formally verified over a program model which abstracts the concrete
program."""
