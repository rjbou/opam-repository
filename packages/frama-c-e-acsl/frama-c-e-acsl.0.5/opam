synopsis: "This package contains the Frama-C's E-ACSL plug-in."
description: """
It takes as input an annotated C program and returns the same program
in which annotations have been converted into C code dedicated to
runtime assertion checking: this code fails at runtime if the
annotation is violated at runtime.

Annotations must be written in a subset of ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification
Language), namely E-ACSL (Executable ANSI/ISO C Specification Language). E-ACSL
is fully described at http://frama-c.com/download/e-acsl/e-acsl.pdf"""
