synopsis: "Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP) library"
description: """
WAMP is a routed protocol that provides two messaging patterns:
Publish & Subscribe and routed Remote Procedure Calls.  It is intended
to connect application components in distributed applications.  WAMP
uses WebSocket as its default transport, but can be transmitted via
any other protocol that allows for ordered, reliable, bi-directional,
and message-oriented communications."""
