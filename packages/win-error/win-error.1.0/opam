description: """
If your application is likely to run on Windows, simply replace uses of
`Unix.error_message` with `Win_error.error_message`. When the application
runs on Windows, Windows system errors will be decoded; when the application
runs elsewhere then the existing `Unix.error_message` function is
called transparently."""
