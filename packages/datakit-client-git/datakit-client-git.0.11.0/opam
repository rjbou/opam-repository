synopsis: "Orchestrate applications using a Git-like dataflow"
description: """
*DataKit* is a tool to orchestrate applications using a Git-like dataflow. It
revisits the UNIX pipeline concept, with a modern twist: streams of
tree-structured data instead of raw text. DataKit allows you to define
complex build pipelines over version-controlled data.

DataKit is currently used as the coordination
layer for [HyperKit](http://github.com/docker/hyperkit), the
hypervisor component of
[Docker for Mac and Windows](https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-for-mac-windows-beta/), and
for the [DataKitCI][] continuous integration system."""
