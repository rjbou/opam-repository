version: "0.15.0"
synopsis:
  "A static web site compiler, handling blog posts, or XML document in general."
description: """
Main features:
- generate static XML/HTML documents: easy to deploy, less security problems,
- handling of blog posts, with dates, topics, keywords and associated RSS feeds,
- no new syntax,
- based on a XML rewrite engine allowing to apply substitutions (rewrite rules)
  on some tags. Some substitutions are pre-defined, and others can be defined
  in your documents or added by plugins. Content can then be written with
  semantic tags,
- support multi-language sites,
- a lot of predefined functions can be used to handle sectionning, table of
  contents, verified cross-references, ...,
- OCaml code can be interpreted at compilation time and the result included in
  the generated documents, which is nice to write tutorials on OCaml libraries,
- some plugins ease the inclusion of graphviz graphs, and pictures generated
  by Aysmptote or LaTeX,
