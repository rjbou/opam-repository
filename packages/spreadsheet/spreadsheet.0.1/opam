description: """
Defines a spreadsheet functor and `RowSpec` module type.
When given a `RowSpec`, the functor produces a module that will represent a
spreadsheet backed by a set.
The programmer must provide a `RowSpec` module, which is essentially:
- An OCaml type to describe spreadsheet rows.
- Coercions from the row type to/from `string`.
- A `string list` title describing each column of the spreadsheet."""
