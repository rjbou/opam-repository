synopsis: "Context-free grammar based random text generator"
description: """
cfgen generated random text based on context-free grammars
defined in BNF-like syntax. It's primarily meant for parser
fuzzing. If a rule has multiple alternative, they are selected
randomly. To influence the choice, you can specify weight for
each alternative, as in
<start> ::= 10 "aaa" <start> | 5 "bbb" <start> | "ccc";"""
