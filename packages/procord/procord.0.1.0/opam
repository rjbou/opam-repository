synopsis: "Procord: a portable library to delegate tasks to other processes."
description: """
Procord can spawn local worker processes or communicate using sockets to a remote worker server. Workers will receive an input, execute a function on this input, and send back the result. Meanwhile, the main program can continue to run while waiting for the results.

Not relying on threads, Procord is robust - a segmentation fault in the worker will not kill the main program. Not relying on fork, Procord is portable - it has been tested on Linux and Windows.

Procord provides an easy way to have the same executable act as a worker - local or remote - or as the main program. The actual behavior can be specified on the command-line. The default is to run as the main program, which delegates tasks by running itself."""
