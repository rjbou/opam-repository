  "Barreto-Naehrig 128 Elliptic Curve pairing function library in OCAML"
description: """
bn128-ml is an OCAML library providing access to the Barreto-Naehrig-128
elliptic curve, including field operations over the relevant field,
elliptic curve operations over the G1, G2, and G12 curves, and a
pairing function which accepts a point in G1 and a point in G2 and
pairs it into a point in G12."""
