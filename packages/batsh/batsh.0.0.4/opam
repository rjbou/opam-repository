Online demo: http://batsh.byvoid.com/

* Remove dependency to Core (use Core_kernel instead).
* Rewrite command line front end with Cmdliner.
* Add unit tests for code.
* Stop printing redundant parentheses of arithmetic expressions (bash).
* Not split string comparison expression from if statement (bash).
* Not split list from assignment (winbat).
* Escape caret specially if exclamation mark is observed (winbat)."""
