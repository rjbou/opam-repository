synopsis: "Constant time equal function on `string`"
description: """
From some crypto libraries like
[digestif](https://github.com/mirage/digestif.git) or
[Callipyge](https://github.com/oklm-wsh/Callipyge.git), it needed to have a
constant time equal function to avoid timing attacks. To avoid replication of
code and ensure maintainability of this kind of function, we decide to provide a
little package which implements `equal` function on `string`.

This package provides 2 implementations (a C implementation which comes from
OpenBSD's code and an OCaml implementation which is simply a translation of the
C code) well tested to check constant time assumption (see tests).

Happy hacking!"""
