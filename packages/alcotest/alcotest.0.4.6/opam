synopsis: "Alcotest is a lightweight and colourful test framework."
description: """
Alcotest exposes simple interface to perform unit tests. It exposes
a simple `TESTABLE` module type, a `check` function to assert test
predicates and a `run` function to perform a list of `unit -> unit`
test callbacks.

Alcotest provides a quiet and colorful output where only faulty runs
are fully displayed at the end of the run (with the full logs ready to
inspect), with a simple (yet expressive) query language to select the
tests to run."""
