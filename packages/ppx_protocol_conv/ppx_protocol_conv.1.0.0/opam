synopsis:
  "Serialization and de-serialization of ocaml types to/from json, msgpack and xml_light."
description: """
The syntax extension generates code to serialize and de-serialize
types. The ppx itself does not contain any protocol specific code,
but relies on 'drivers' that defines serialization and
de-serialisation of basic types and structures.

The library provides the following drivers for serialization
and deserialization:
 * json (Yojson.Safe.json)
 * xml_light (Xml.xml)
 * msgpack (Msgpck.t)"""
