description: """
OCamllint is a ppx plugin that checks for patterns in a OCaml code base:

  - common programming errors: using the wrong kind of comparison, computing
    unused values, going several times through a data structure, etc.
  - enforce style: use snake_case for identifiers, module types in caps, etc."""
