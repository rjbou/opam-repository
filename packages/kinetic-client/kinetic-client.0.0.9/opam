synopsis: "Client for Seagate's kinetic drives."
description: """
Kinetic drives are HDDs that also run a little socket server exposing a network protocol, making the component act like a
key value store. This library allows you to talk to use the drives.

NOTE: Although there is a simulator, the drives themselves have a different behaviour.
      This client lib is tested against the drives (not the simulator)"""
