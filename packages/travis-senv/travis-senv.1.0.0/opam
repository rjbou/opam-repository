description: """
`travis-senv` is a utility to make it easier to move secure key files in and
out of the Travis continuous integration environment.  You can find the general
instructions on secure environments on the Travis site, but this command takes
care of splitting up larger files (e.g. SSH private keys) into multiple
environment variable so that they fit into the keyspace."""
