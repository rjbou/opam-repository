synopsis: "DNS client and server implementation in pure OCaml"
description: """
This is a pure OCaml implementation of the DNS protocol.  It is intended to be
a reasonably high-performance implementation, but clarity is preferred rather
than low-level performance hacks.

There are several concrete implementations using this package that you probably
want to use for practical purposes:

- dns-lwt for the Lwt concurrency library
- dns-lwt-unix using the Lwt_unix bindings
- dns-async using the Jane Street Async library
- mirage-dns for the MirageOS unikernel framework"""
