synopsis: "Logging infrastructure for OCaml"
description: """
Logs provides a logging infrastructure for OCaml. Logging is performed
on sources whose reporting level can be set independently. Log message
report is decoupled from logging and is handled by a reporter.

A few optional log reporters are distributed with the base library and
the API easily allows to implement your own.

`Logs` depends only on the `result` compatibility package. The
optional `Logs_stdo` reporter on standard outputs depends
on [Fmt][1].  The `Logs_browser` reporter that reports to the web
browser console depends on [js_of_ocaml][2]. The optional `Logs_cli`
library that provides command line support for controlling Logs
depends on [`Cmdliner`][3].

Logs and its reporters are distributed under the BSD3 license.
