synopsis: "Minimalistic library allowing to exploit multicore architecture"
description: """
Parmap is a minimalistic library allowing to exploit multicore
architecture for OCaml programs with minimal modifications: if you
want to use your many cores to accelerate an operation which happens
to be a map, fold or map/fold (map-reduce), just use Parmapâ€™s parmap,
parfold and parmapfold primitives in place of the standard List.map
and friends, and specify the number of subprocesses to use by the
optional parameter ~ncores."""
