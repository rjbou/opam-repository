description: """
SETr is an interface for set abstractions. It defines common infrastructure for
abstracting set constraints for use in an abstract interpreter. Built upon this
interface, it provides a number of included abstractions usable as libraries.
These included abstractions are tuned for high-performance, symbolic (no known
constants), relational (constraints over multiple variables) constraints."""
